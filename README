Hello!

This is 'mercyboy', a Nintendo Gameboy emulator I've started as a little side 
project to mess with emulation, refresh plain C knowledge and tinker around
with SDL. 

The purpose of this is to be simple and small, I'll probably make it run on 
DOS at some point in time.

The license of choice is CC-BY-NC.

It's a QT Creator / QMake project for now, because I like fancy IDEs and am 
lazy.

Have fun!
